Integration of devops tools to deploy an application
# Go Application Deployment with Jenkins, Terraform, and Docker

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline for deploying a Go application to a cloud environment. The pipeline includes building the Go application, provisioning infrastructure on DigitalOcean using Terraform, and deploying the application using Docker. Jenkins orchestrates the entire process.

## Project Overview

The main components of this project include:

- **Jenkins**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) server to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to provision and manage cloud infrastructure on DigitalOcean.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool to package and deploy the Go application in a consistent environment.

## Architecture

The project follows a linear deployment process:

1. **Source Code Management**: Go application source code is stored in a Git repository.
2. **Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment stages.
3. **Terraform Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform provisions the required cloud infrastructure on DigitalOcean.
4. **Docker Container Deployment**: The Go application is packaged as a Docker container and deployed on the provisioned server.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: Version control system to manage code repositories.
- **Jenkins**: Installed and configured on a dedicated server.
- **Terraform**: Installed on the Jenkins server or accessible via Jenkins.
- **Docker**: Installed on the target deployment server.
- **DigitalOcean Account**: To provision cloud infrastructure.
- **Go**: Installed on the build server for compiling the application.

## Setup Instructions

## Future Enhancements
Automated Testing: Integrate a testing framework (e.g., go test) to automate application testing.
Multiple Environments: Expand Terraform configuration to support multiple environments (e.g., staging, production).
Monitoring: Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor the application's health and performance.
CI/CD Enhancements: Add more advanced CI/CD practices such as Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Releases, or Rollbacks.
Configuration Management with Chef: Incorporate Chef to manage and automate the application deployment process, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments.
