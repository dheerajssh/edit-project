Integration of devops tools to deploy an application
# Go Application Deployment with Jenkins, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes

This project demonstrates a comprehensive DevOps pipeline for deploying a Go application in a cloud environment. The pipeline includes building the Go application, provisioning infrastructure on various cloud providers using Terraform, and deploying the application using Docker containers managed by Kubernetes. Jenkins orchestrates the entire process.

## Project Overview

This project integrates multiple DevOps tools to automate the deployment of a Go application. It uses Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

- **Jenkins**: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes in a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- **Terraform**: An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to provision cloud infrastructure on AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the Go application and MySQL database, ensuring consistent environments across different stages of the deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages the deployment and scaling of Docker containers, ensuring high availability and efficient resource management.

## Architecture

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Source Code Management**: Go application source code is stored in a Git repository.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins automates the entire pipeline, from building the Go application to deploying it in a cloud environment.
3. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform provisions the required cloud infrastructure, including VMs with Docker and Minikube installed.
4. **Container Deployment**: Docker images for the Go application and MySQL database are created and loaded into Kubernetes pods for deployment.

The architecture diagram illustrates the flow from code development and CI/CD orchestration by Jenkins, to infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, and finally, application deployment managed by Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- **Git**: For version control and managing code repositories.
- **Jenkins**: Installed and configured on a dedicated server to handle CI/CD pipelines.
- **Terraform**: Installed on the Jenkins server or accessible through Jenkins for provisioning infrastructure.
- **Docker**: Installed on target deployment servers to run containers.
- **Minikube**: Installed on the target machine to manage the Kubernetes cluster locally.
- **A cloud platform**: For provisioning cloud infrastructure (Currently featuring AWS, Azure and DigitalOcean).
- **Go**: Installed on the build server to compile the application.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dheerajssh/edit-project.git

### 2. Configure Jenkins
- Install the necessary plugins for Git, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- Set up Jenkins credentials for accessing the Git repository and cloud provider.
- Create Jenkins pipelines for the CI and CD processes.

### 3. Configure Terraform
- Set up your Terraform environment with your cloud provider credentials.
- Modify `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `secret.tfvars` according to your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean).

### 4. Create Docker Images
- Use Jenkins to create Docker images for the Go application and MySQL database.
- Save these images locally and transfer them to the target machine.

### 5. Deploy with Kubernetes
- Apply Kubernetes configurations using `kubectl` to deploy the Docker containers as pods on the target machine.
- Ensure that services are configured to allow communication between the Go application and MySQL database.

## Jenkins Pipeline

### CI Pipeline
- Pulls the latest code from the Git repository.
- Compiles the Go application.
- Creates Docker images for the application and database.
- Saves the Docker images as `.tar` files for deployment.

### CD Pipeline
- Provisions the infrastructure using Terraform.
- Transfers the Docker images and Kubernetes YAML files to the target machine.
- Deploys the Docker images using Kubernetes on the target machine.

## Terraform Configuration
- `main.tf`: Contains the main Terraform configuration for provisioning the VM on the cloud provider.
- `variables.tf`: Stores variables for the Terraform configuration.
- `secret.tfvars`: Contains sensitive information, such as cloud provider credentials.

## Kubernetes Deployment
- `backend-deployment.yml`: Configures the deployment of the Go application with environment
- `mysql-deployment.yml`: Configures the deployment of the MySQL database.

## Usage
1. Start the Jenkins server and run the CI/CD pipelines.
2. Monitor Jenkins to ensure all steps are executed successfully.
3. Access the application via the IP address or DNS name of the deployed service.

## Future Enhancements
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate a testing framework (e.g., go test) to automate application testing.
- **Multi-Cloud Environment Support**: Expand Terraform configuration to support multiple environments across various cloud providers
- **Monitoring**: Integrate the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to monitor the application's health, performance and logs.
- **CI/CD Enhancements**: Add more advanced CI/CD practices such as Blue-Green Deployment and Rollback mechanism.
- **Configuration Management**: Incorporate Chef to manage and automate the application deployment process, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments.
